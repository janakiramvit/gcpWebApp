# gcpWebApp
Using java spring boot, angular, html for building a web app on google cloud.

I have not followed the google model to create the webapp, its just my own model, but its been inspired from what Google taught. Also I put Chanrith's name here as I took his help through out in developing this project.

Points to check:
- in pom.xml, check properties tag, additional properties or values have to be included there
